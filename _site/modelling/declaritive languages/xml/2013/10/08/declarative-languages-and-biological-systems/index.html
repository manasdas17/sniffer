    <h1>Declarative languages and biological systems </h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>A program written in declarative paradigm does not specify "how to do it" (like
we do in C, Python etc.), it only contains statements which at best tell the
computer "what to do". The spice netlist is one such example, here we  tell
ngspice or some other spice, what to compute (like .OP, .DC, .AC etc.). To be
sure, these distinction are rather based on arguments which are nothing but
"hand-waving", but too many people use these terms to ignore them. For example,
FIFO (First In First Out) is an algorithm, but people often use it as if it is
an object (Queue).</p>

<p>There is no thick-line which strictly separates languages according to these
categories. Following example which computes factorial can be classified 
"somewhat declarative" (written in functional programming language haskell).
Here, we are not exactly saying how to "really" compute a factorial of a natural
number.</p>

<blockquote><p>(one of these snippets is tested).</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not sure if to be "declarative", a program must lack  control flow or there
is a consistent theoretical category into which a program must fit.</p>

<p>Till people with neat theoretical mind fix the confusion for us, we can look at
the uses of this paradigm. There are many and quick search will reveal some. Let
me share one on which currently I have to work (not enjoying it too much) i.e.
modeling large scale neural networks.</p>

<p>A VLSI engineer is trained not to be frightened with numbers of components. But
unlike CMOS devices, two neurons even when they belong to same class much like
two humans, do not behave in the same way. Fortunately their behaviour is not
without a pattern, so attempts are being made to model them (as a real
biological network) for a computer to answer few questions.</p>

<p>Already much work has been done in the area of classifying neurons and finding
equivalent "electrical models" of them; they have been simulated independently
and sometimes as a group of few. These models were saved in some format and
there are now many such formats. Efforts are on way to standardize them.</p>

<p>It is agreed in general that some declarative paradigm will be most suitable for
Biologists might not prefer to learn a language to tell the computer "how to do
it", they would rather concentrate on "what to do". Neither it is expected from
them. Engineers find it hard to learn a second language. Many avoid going
thoroughly the first one.</p>

<p>Astronomers have been using HDF5 format to store complex data (hierarchical
patterns). Now there is XML technology all around. XML looks dirty to human eyes
but a computer can easily read them. So why not describe "what to do" in XML.
Imagine, rewriting a ngspice script in XML format and what they wish to do will
be clear. The major difference however remains, two neurons belonging to same
class do not behave like two capacitor or two transistors.  Much depends on how
they are connected and who is around them doing what; and what is happening at
different scales. A release of certain chemicals or presence of certain ions can
not only change the values of component in equivalent circuit model, it can also
change the circuit model itself. The speed of computation depends mainly on how
fast you can solve electrical circuits. But there is concernt whether a "jack of
all trade" simulator is sufficient.</p>

<p>Multiscale modelling, as it is called these days, is found to capture biological
systems. How changes in "one scale"changes the behaviour at different scale?
This is answered by experimentalists. They also prepare models to capture the
behaviour. And how to describe it is usually done by, well, programmers. Now the
problem, is how to describe a model for multiscale-modellings; if not using some
data-base (XML)?</p>

<p>To me, it looks like more of sociology of neurons than computation of networks.
There is a lot of scope of hand-waving and null-hypothesises; and along with it,
as usually the case in these professions, much scope for personal ingenuity. I
prefer my boring subjects where step by step reasoning using well-established
tricks yield results about an idea.</p>

<p>Some people have used Erlang to model "brain" given its capacity to easily
launch millions of threads. Each neuron is encoded in a process and one can
launch as many as one wants. Messages among these processes represents changing
environment and what one neuron is sending to other. Theoretically, its is
pretty neat.</p>

<p>The principle of reality appears to ruin the party: how to crunch numbers as
soon as next update is available? One can also simulate them as VLSI models are
simulated using HDL but that will be incredibly slow. Erlang is not reputed to
be a number-crunching language. But there is scope here for at least modelling
very simple "spike models" or "integrate and fire model" but I am not aware if
anything has been done on these lines. Availability of many-core hardware on
which one can launch many threads will solve many problems. But again since the
behaviour of two neurons is not same, you can not model them which might put you
in a position where you use embarrassingly parallelism available as "single
instruction" working on "multiple data".  Besides that would not be research,
that is just development, no matter how important it is.</p>

<p>Those who are more interested in how biological systems are modelled in
multi-scale ways can look-up this entry from the lab for last year google summer
of code. GSoC is co-ordinated by INCF India node.
