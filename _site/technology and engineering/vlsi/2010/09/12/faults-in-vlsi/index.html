    <h1>Overview of Faults in VLSI </h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>Someone who has access to market and someone who has access to capital came up
with an evil plan. They want to make a VLSI circuit and then they will fabricate
it and sell it to puny humans to make money [Evil laugh]. What they want to
create will surely depend on what their consumers will find useful. So they hire
someone who has expertise in consumer electronics and pays her to figure out
what they can sell to them with some good profit. After doing her tricks, she
gives them certain <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document">product
reqpuirements</a>.
</strong>Now these product requirements are sent to us - the engineers. We try very
hard to concentrate on them and after some time under the influence of burnt-out
neurons, we are able to draw up <strong><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04644754">specifications of VLSI
circuit</a>. </strong>These
specification usually describes the <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhklenke/tutorials/vhdl/modules/m12_23/sld006.htm">behaviour of the circuit (e.g. in VHDL,
Verilog).</a>
Moreover, this specifications are embedded inside the model of the environment
in which this circuit suppose to work. For example, a chip designed to work over
Himalayas needs to be tested for temperature range -20 to -50 degree centigrade,
however if the targeted consumers are normal lesser mortals working in their
cozy rooms, these conditions of negative temperature can be relaxed or dropped
altogether.</p>

<p>Now, my job starts. Based on these specifications, I have to come up with a
design. Depending on the level of my experiences and expertise in design, I
refine my design over the time mostly by trial and error, and educated guesses.
During all these trials, errors, and educated guesses, I 'll have my moment of
genius which even I can not control.Â  Normally, all these testing and designing
are done with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/electric/">T-CAD tools</a>. Ultimately
I'll produce a <a href="http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/"><strong>layout<em> </em></strong></a>of the
circuit which is to be manufactured.</p>

<p>The layout then converted into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-micro.deis.unibo.it%2F~masetti%2FDida01%2FtecCMOS.pdf&amp;ei=tcKMTPeQEcL98AbA1Nm2Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_uwbDnnSLEtz17dpKB0TF5ZeCxQ&amp;sig2=rcBxcuCWfQ4df57MsPE0Vw">masks which are used to fabricate
</a>this
circuit in a fabrication facility.</p>

<h1>Testing, Verification and Validation</h1>

<p>I do have trouble making distinction among these words but there are few things
which are different in them and are easy to see. Here, I define these terms as
defined by our Professor, <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/madhav">Madhav P. Desai
</a>during the course on
<em>Verification and Testing of VLSI Circuits</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By testing, we normally refer to the process used to determine <strong>that the
manufactured circuit is functional</strong>. Every manufactured circuit needs to be
tested, and the result of the test should, with a <strong>high degree of
confidence</strong>, determine that the circuit is functional.</p></li>
<li><p>By verification, we normally refer to the process used to confirm that
<strong>refinements in the design process are consistent with the circuit
specification</strong>. For example, when a logic circuit is implemented using
transistors, we need to verify that the transistor network is equivalent to
the logic circuit which it is supposed to implement. This is done at each
refinement step in the design process.</p></li>
<li><p>By validation, we normally refer to the process used to confirm that a
functional manufactured <strong>circuit will fulfill the requirements</strong> to which
it was designed. This usually involves construction of a prototype and a
test setup which mimics reality to the <strong>maximum extent possible</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After the fabrication, circuit must behave the way it was designed for, else we
have failed as engineers. However, since no process is fault free, it could
happen that the end product behave in unexpected ways. I like to think of it as
<strong>this chip has developed a sense of humor. </strong>Now all these above mentioned
processes can be utilized to remove this <strong>sense of humor </strong>out of the chip to
make it behave in boring and rigid ways again. At the end of the day, it should
work as it is told. <strong>Humor is the prerogative of Humans, machines must be
humorless.</strong></p>

<h1>Faults in VLSI</h1>

<p>Faults in VLSI can occur due to various reasons. Most prominent among them is
due to flaws and variation fabrication processes (when engineer is competent).
These causes of faults are discussed in <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37888.37914">[Mally,
1987]</a>. Break in metal lines,
over and under deposition of material, alien particles in fabrication process
are the major sources of faults. As a designer, we need to test these faults as
early as possible. Later the fault is located, costlier it gets by an order of
magnitude (I do not have exact numbers here).</p>

<p>Following figure 1 shows a messed-up device fabricated by me with the help of
lab-staff during my M. Tech. Though it was useless for us then, it is useful for
us for our present discussion.</p>

Figure 2 : Alien particles during fabrication. Short of tacks.[/caption]</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the alien particles causing the short. Extra deposition and less
deposition of materials cause most of the shorts and open circuits problem.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the less deposition of material causing a track to be less
conductive. Any logic propagated through this track will be weaker than the
perfect track.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows that in spite of material deposition was sufficient, part of the
track may still come off due to less adhesion between the deposited material and
the substance.</p>

Si" /></a>
Figure 4 : SEM image shows that gold may not stick very well to the Si
substrate. Same thing can happen with other pairs of material.[/caption]</p>

Figure 3 : Less materical deposition causing partial break in track.[/caption]</p>

<p>These faults, among others, are classified as spot defects. Geometrically, these
are randomly distributed over the entire fabrication area. For more details on
these faults we refer to <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37888.37914">[Mally,
1987]</a>. To summarize,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spot defects are regions of missing or extra material, (or drastically
changed with physical material characteristics) that may occur in any layer
of the fabricated IC.</p></li>
<li><p>These are expressed as number of defects per unit area. However, some
defects such as oxide pinholes and substrate dislocation can be expressed in
density only.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster per unit area describes proneness of a region for defects.
Distribution of defect size is also a prominent fault-matrix component.</p></li>
<li><p>Short is generally caused by extra material deposition at a spot of missing
insulating material between two conductive tracks.</p></li>
<li><p>Break is generally caused by missing conductive material or extra insulating
material in insulating windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Shorts and breaks occur both in horizontal and vertical direction. Since
these days there are multi layer fabrication process are done in modern chip
fabrication. Vertical shorts and breaks are as important as the horizontal
one.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Fault Modeling</h1>

<h2>Test Sequence Detectability</h2>

<p>Let's make a gauge to measure how fault-free my circuit is. If I do a test, can
I answer this question. <strong>What are the chances that a successfully tested IC
still contains undetected faults? [FOOTNOTE] </strong>Such is measure which one can
name <strong>test sequence detectability, </strong>$$D$$<strong>. </strong>It is defined as,</p>

<p>$$D = \prod_{i=1}<sup>{n_e}(1-{p_i})$$</sup></p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>$$p_i$$ is the probability of the occurrence of faults andÂ  $$n_e$$ are
the faults that can not be detected by a given test sequence. Well, defining it
this make sense to me.</p>

<p>If I can list out all the possible faults that can occur in my circuit and their
number is $$n$$. Let assume that $$n_f$$ is the number of faults which I
am testing my circuit for and letÂ  $$n_e$$ are the faults which I can NOT
detect during my test. Then, $$\frac{n_f -n_e}{n_f}$$ represent
traditional fault coverage and, of course, $$n > n_f$$.</p>

<p>Hence an ultimate fault model must list out all the possible faults with their
probability of occurrence. Practically, these faults model are based on the
experience of an Institute or company. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=784281&amp;tag=1">[Birolini,
1994]</a> gives
details about fault occurrence in VLSI circuits. Some figures are given below.</p>

<h1>Stuck at Models</h1>

<p>A traditional model is <strong>stuck at model</strong>.<em> </em>In this model, one prescribe to the
lines in the logic representation on the IC either state '1' or state '0' as
permanent state.</p>

<p>TODO : Give a brief overview. Meanwhile readers can refer to a book by Kohavi.</p>
