Download the zip file from {{page.repository_url}} and use `python-setuptools`
to install it. I recommend using `pip` or `easy_install`; it install it from
pypi where a stable version is kept.

    $ pip install code-sniffer 

If you are behind proxy, check out how to use `pip` behind proxy. You can also
download the code from its [gihub repository]({{page.repository_url}}). Run the
following command

    $ python setup.py build 
    $ sudo python setup.py install 

Any of these two method will install code-sniffer to your system
