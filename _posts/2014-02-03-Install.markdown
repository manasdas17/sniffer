    $ sudo python setup.py install 

Any of these two method will install code-sniffer to your system

## How to use it

First you need to create a configuration file `~/.config/sniffer/config`. You
can see a [sample file here]({{ page.repository_url }}/master/blob/snifferrc).
If you choose to save this file at some other location, you need to specify the
location using `--config` option at command line e.g.

    $ code-sniffer --config ~/.snifferrc
